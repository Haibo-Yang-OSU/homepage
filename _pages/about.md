My name is Haibo Yang. I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Dept. of ECE](https://ece.osu.edu/) at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Jia(Kevin) Liu](https://kevinliu-osu-ece.github.io/liu/).


Research Interests
------

My research generally centers around distributed/federated learning. More specifically, I am interested in providing fundamental understandings of how distributed/federated learning algorithms are influenced by statistical variability and system variability due to privacy, communication and other constrains. Inspired by the theoretical insights, I am seeking to develop intelligent and efficient algorithms to better fit large-scale distributed/federated system.

* First-order stochastic optimization algorithms.<br>
To develop provable first-order stochastic optimization algorithms for convex/non-convex problems.
Particular interests lies in methods that accelerate and stabilize training, such as momentum and variance reduction. 

* Communication-Efficient Distributed/Federated Learning.<br>
To develop communication-efficient algorithm in different dataset and system settings of distributed learning, for example, with heterogeneous dataset, partial clients participation, and unbalanced environment.

* Robust Machine Learning.<br>
To develop secure deep learning algorithm albeit with potential attackers in the system.
