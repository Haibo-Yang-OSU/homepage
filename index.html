        <h1>Short Biography</h1>
        <p> Haibo Yang is an Assistant Professor in the Dept. of Computing and Information Sciences Ph.D. at <a href="https://www.rit.edu/computing/">Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences</a> in Rochester Institute of Technology. He received his Ph.D degree from the <a href="https://ece.osu.edu/">Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering </a> at <a href="https://www.osu.edu/">Ohio State University</a>, advised by <a href="https://kevinliu-osu.github.io/"> Prof. Jia(Kevin) Liu</a>.</p>

        <p><b>Immediate openings for fully funded Ph.D. students:</b></p>

        <p>Iâ€™m looking for 2-3 Ph.D. students starting 2026 Fall/Spring. Ideal candidates should be curious, self-motivated, and eager to explore interdisciplinary research. Prior publications is not a requirement, but they are highly appreciated (e.g. NuerIPS, ICML, ICLR). Each student will be equipped with one high-end desktop with GPU RAM, supported with fellowships and full-time RAs.
One position will focus on AI for drug discovery and molecular design, so students with backgrounds in biology, chemistry, or related fields are highly encouraged to apply. Another position will focus on deep learning and optimization theory, so students with strong mathematical backgrounds in statistics, optimization, or related areas are especially encouraged. Overall, students with strong backgrounds in statistics, mathematics, optimization, computer science, electrical engineering, biology and physics are encouraged to apply. Please drop me an email if you are interested in working with me!</p>
  
        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <p>My research generally centers around distributed/federated learning. More specifically, I am interested in providing fundamental understandings of how distributed/federated learning algorithms are influenced by statistical variability and system variability due to privacy, communication and other constrains. Inspired by the theoretical insights, I am seeking to develop intelligent and efficient algorithms to better fit large-scale distributed/federated system.</p>
